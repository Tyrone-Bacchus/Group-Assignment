# A simple turn-based sieging RPG game.
# Creation of this game contributed to 15% of everyone's mark in the grade 12 Computer Science class.

# As the vice-president in charge of coding for this group project, I had the responsibility to compile the various components of this game. 
# I learned how to better manage both my own time, as well as the time of others.
# I also learned how to coordinate multiple people and use their strengths to their fullest.

# The resulting game was intuitive to play, and reinforced what we've learned about manipulating objects and the values within said objects.
